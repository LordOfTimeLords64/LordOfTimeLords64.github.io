## Welcome to the homepage of Michael Komnick

I'm a full time student at the University of the South studying computer science. I enjoy using my Dell T110 with Ubuntu Server to host websites, video game servers, media streaming services, and file sharing services for me and my friends. I also enjoy building and repairing computers and other electronics.
